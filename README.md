## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Grocery refers to food items and household goods that are sold by retailers, such as supermarkets, grocery stores, and online grocers, for consumption and use by households. Grocery shopping is a routine activity for most people and typically involves buying items such as fresh produce, meat, dairy products, packaged goods, and cleaning supplies.

Grocery stores offer a wide range of products to meet the diverse needs and preferences of customers. They may also offer specialty items, such as organic or gluten-free products, international foods, and local or regional products.

Grocery shopping has evolved over time, with many retailers now offering online ordering and home delivery services for added convenience. This has become particularly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many people opting to shop online to minimize their exposure to the virus.

Overall, grocery shopping and the food industry as a whole play an important role in our daily lives, providing us with the essential items we need to nourish ourselves and our families.
